Problem Statement: 
Let’s put ourselves in the shoes of a childcare provider.
As childcare providers, we have an essential role in children’s lives by helping them learn and grow. You help children get the nourishment and energy they need to learn and grow by providing healthy meals. 

Also, keep in mind that preschoolers who eat a variety of healthy foods and play actively several times every day are less likely to be overweight or obese.

In this assignment, you will try to calculate a child's nutritions, using Python. This is a compulsory individual assignment wherein you will write Python code to take input from the user,  set various conditions, calculate BMI and calorie consumption, and submit the code.

Hints:
Create a child nutrition calculator based on the following tasks & conditions:
The calculator should be able to store the details of the child such as the name, age, gender, height and weight.
Calculate the BMI of the child using the standard BMI formula.
Display the minimum daily calorie requirement based on age. Use the below criteria to display the same:

Age b/w 0-2 years: 800 calories
Age b/w 2-4 years: 1400 calories
Age b/w 4-8 years: 1800 calories
Take as input what that child has eaten throughout the day and in what quantities.

Calculate the daily calorie consumption based on the following criteria:
Milk: 100 cal/ 100g
Egg: 155 cal/ 100g
Rice: 130 cal/ 100g
Lentils: 113 cal/ 100g
Vegetable: 85 cal/100g
Meat: 143 cal/ 100g
Next, compare the daily consumption with the recommended value and print if the child is undernourished or not.




Code Starts from Here(Written in Python):

# CHILD NUTRITION CALCULATOR.
class nutrition:
  # This function will store the details about the child.
  def __init__(self,name,age,gender,height,weight):
    self.name = name 
    self.age = age 
    self.gender = gender 
    self.height = height 
    self.weight = weight 

  # This function will calculate BMI and thell the condion of the child
  def BMI(self):
    BMI = self.weight/(self.height * self.height)
    BMI_round = round(BMI,2)
    print("1). The BMI of the child is: ",BMI_round)
    print("2). The Condition of the child on the basis is BMI is given below.")
    # This section will tell BMI Category
    if(BMI < 16):
      print("\t Severely Underweight")
    elif(BMI >= 16 and BMI < 18.5):
      print("\t Underweight")
    elif(BMI >= 18.5 and BMI < 25):
      print("\t Healthy")
    elif(BMI >= 25 and BMI < 30):
      print("\t Overweight")
    else:
      print("\t Obese")
  
  # This function will tell how much calorie is required by the child.
  def calorie_requirement(self):
    if(self.age >= 0 and self.age < 2):
      print("3). Calories Required by your child: 800 calories")
    elif(self.age >= 2 and self.age < 4):
      print("3). Calories Required by your child: 1400 calories")
    elif(self.age >= 4 and self.age < 8):
      print("3). Calories Required by your child: 1800 calories")

  # This function will ask the user about what there child have eaten and accordingly it will tell that wheather the child is undernourished or not.
  def calorie_consumption(self,milk,egg,rice,lentils,vegetables,meat):
    milk_cal = 1 * milk
    egg_cal = 0.66 * egg
    rice_cal = 0.76 * rice
    lentils_cal = 0.88 * lentils
    veg_cal = 1.17 * vegetables
    meat_cal = 0.69 * meat

    # Total Calories consumed by the child
    total_calories = milk_cal + egg_cal + rice_cal + lentils_cal + veg_cal + meat_cal
    print("Total calories taken by the child: ",total_calories)

    # Checking wheather the child is undernourished or not
    if(self.age >= 0 and self.age < 2):
      if(total_calories < 800):
        print("4). Child is Undernourished")
      else:
        print("4). Child is not Undernourished")
    elif(self.age >= 2 and self.age < 4):
      if(total_calories < 1400):
        print("4). Child is Undernourished")
      else:
        print("4). Child is not Undernourished")
    elif(self.age >= 4 and self.age < 8):
      if(total_calories < 1800):
